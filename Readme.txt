Added Auto Kindle Config.exe
This will run if no config file exists and generates a simple text file Config.pnz. Users can generate their own config file. There are only 2 sections first is the default ouput directory eg.

OutputLoc:Default           (this allows the program to prompt you on each file

OutputLoc:InputLocation     (by default the program will place the output file in the same directory as the input file)

OutputLoc:UserDefine        (for UserDefine enter on the next line a Fully Qualified location)
C:\Output

The 2nd option is PDFImage Support
PDFImage:true               (Enables processing of PDF Images)

PDFImage:false              (Disables processing of PDF Images)

So a dummy Config.pnz contents could look like this. eg.
OutputLoc:UserDefine
C:\
PDFImage:true


or

OutputLoc:InputLocation
PDFImage:false

Added Chm file dissassembly support. Handles A few tested issues with the variety of outputs that a chm can create. Builds a manual TOC from __left.htm generated by CHMdecoder by Grindinsoft. Watches for repeated filenames and # anchor redirection before joining the entire document into one file and converting it to mobi. Images are removed as usual.

Converts non-drm lit pdf and html files to mobi format for the kindle and other readers that support this format.
